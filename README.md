## üìå Overview

This project solves a business problem for a fictional company, **ABC Furniture Co.**, which manufactures **chairs** and **tables**. The goal is to **maximize profit** using **Linear Programming (LP)**, subject to **limited resources** (wood and labor).

The optimization is implemented using Python and the **PuLP** library, along with a **visualization of constraints and the feasible region** using **Matplotlib**.

---

## üöÄ Problem Statement

ABC Furniture Co. manufactures:
- **Chairs** (‚Çπ45 profit per unit)
- **Tables** (‚Çπ80 profit per unit)

Subject to:
- **Wood Constraint:** 400 units/week
- **Labor Constraint:** 450 hours/week

Each product consumes:
| Product | Wood (units) | Labor (hours) |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Chair   | 5             | 10             |
| Table   | 20            | 15             |

### Objective:
Maximize profit:
\[
Z = 45x + 80y
\]

## ‚úÖ Solution Summary

| Output                     | Value         |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Optimal Chairs to Produce | 24 units      |
| Optimal Tables to Produce | 14 units      |
| Maximum Profit            | ‚Çπ2200         |
| Wood Used                 | 400 units     |
| Labor Used                | 450 hours     |

All constraints are satisfied, and resources are fully utilized.

## üì¶ Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/) ‚Äî LP modeling and solver
- **Matplotlib** ‚Äî Plotting constraints and feasible region
- **NumPy** ‚Äî Numerical calculations for plotting

## üîß Installation

Clone this repo or download the `.ipynb` notebook. Then install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pulp matplotlib numpy
```

## üìä Visualization

The notebook includes:

- Constraint plots (wood, labor)

- Feasible region

- Optimal solution marked on the graph

- Optional iso-profit line

## üîç Insights & Recommendations

- Produce 24 chairs and 14 tables weekly for maximum profit of ‚Çπ2200.

- Both wood and labor are fully utilized.

- To further scale, consider:

  - Hiring more labor or sourcing more wood.

  - Introducing new products to use idle capacity if it arises.

## üìà Future Scope

- Add demand limits per product

- Include storage or transportation costs

- Handle multiple factories (multi-constraint LP)

- Perform sensitivity analysis or dual LP
